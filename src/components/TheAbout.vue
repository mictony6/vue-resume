        I am Mic, a software and web developer just making stuff that interests me all over the
        internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a dedicated computer programmer trying to undertake every possible chances where I
        can utilize my software development knowledge. Previously, you would find me doing fullstack
        development training as an intern in a
        <a href="https://dteendurance.com/" target="_blank">company</a>. 
        Today, I do freelance content writing on the internet for topics such as <a href="https://www.greenbot.com/author/michael/" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence (AI) news</a> and <a href="https://www.longmontleader.com/writers/michael%20bitoon" target="_blank">travel guide articles</a>. I also dip into the side hobby of developing my own game.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking for a highly motivated and talented developer (or writer) who's passionate about
        bringing your ideas into life, I would love to
